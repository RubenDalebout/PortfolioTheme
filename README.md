# WordPress Theme - Readme

## Introduction

Initially it was planned to create this theme using VueJS, but since I want to get the basics working first, I decided to create a standard Wordpress theme first. In the future I will then decide if I will still make the VueJS version.

## Requirements

- WordPress installation

## Installation

To run this theme, follow these steps:

1. Install WordPress on your web server. If you don't already have WordPress installed, you can follow the official WordPress installation guide at https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/
2. Download the theme files and extract them to the `wp-content/themes` directory.
3. In the WordPress dashboard, go to `Appearance > Themes` and activate the theme.

## Conclusion

With this WordPress theme, you can easily create a stunning portfolio website to showcase your projects and tell your story. Whether you're a freelancer, designer, developer, or artist, this theme provides you with the tools to create a professional and dynamic online presence.
